LilyPCR is a compact panel-mount device. The slique design seperates user interface from the sample area. Configure your cycle from the PC, then press the start button after loading the samples. 

Include LilyPCR in countertops and cabinets. Each device holds six samples. Use an array of devices to multitask.

LilyPCR allows users to program PCR cycles using Arduino IDE. The LilyPCR Arduino Library provides intuative commands. Customize cycles using Arduino code.
